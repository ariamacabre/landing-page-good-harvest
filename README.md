Welcome to Aria's First Coded Landing Page
=================

The Project
------------

For the final class project of my UX Design course in CUNY TechWorks Cohort 8, we were tasked to build a landing page for a seasonal produce app. 
This is what I built! I designed it in Figma to start off as part of our Visual Design module, then as part of the
Coding module, I built the Home Page of the design. Originally this was built in Visual Studio Code, and transferred to Glitch.
This project has gotten me really excited to explore a career track focused on Information Architecture, 
UX Engineering, and Front-End Web Design and Development. Very excited to begin creating and building amazing things!

### ← index.html

Where I've writen the content of my website. 
Feel free to inspect my code and see how I did things!

### ← style.css

CSS files add styling rules to my content.
Includes my responsive web media queries! Try it out by resizing the window and see how I made it responsive. 
I think I could make some small improvements, but for my first try making a webpage responsive from scratch, I think it's pretty awesome!

### ← reset.css

Don't forget to put in your CSS reset file!

### ← script.js

No JavaScript yet, but as I'm writing this, I'm currently learning the fundamentals! I'm using freecodecamp.org supported by AnitaB.org and SkillShare.com! 
Hope to be proficient in JavaScript for implementation in Front End Design and Prototyping this year! Whoop whoop!
